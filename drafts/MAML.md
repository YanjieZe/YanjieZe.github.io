# Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning(MAML)

Yanjie Ze, July 2021

# 1 Introduction

key idea:

to train the modelâ€™s initial parameters such that the model has maximal performance on a new task after the parameters have been updated through one or more gradient steps computed with a small amount of data from that new task.

main contribution:

a model-agnostic and task-agnostic algorithm for meta-learning **(with rapid adaptation)**
